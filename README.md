## $\text{Introduction}$
$\text{Fully Connected Neural Network(FNN) is a type of Artificial Neural Network. FNNs has been popular in computer vision, and are gaining }$ 
$\text{popularity in a variety of fields, including radiology}$

$\text{Traditional Fully Connected Neural Networks use CPUs to carry out calculations. Such calculations are wasteful and slow, and thus make}$
$\text{it impossible to meet real-time calculating needs.}$ $\text{As a result, convolutional neural networks based on graphics processing units}$
$\text{ (GPUs) are commonly used. The literature evaluated CNN open source projects that use GPUs and discovered that GPUs have some drawbacks,}$
$\text{ such as high power consumption and high cost. Taking this into account, FPGA is a better fit as it is a low power device, which provides }$
$\text{a similar degree of acceleration to a GPU.}$

$\text{In this project fully connected neural network is implemented in synthesizable} \textbf{ Verilog}. \text{ This is deployable on FPGAs after some minor changes.}$
