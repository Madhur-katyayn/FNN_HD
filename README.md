## $\text{Introduction}$
$\text{Fully Connected Neural Network(FNN) is a type of Artificial Neural Network. FNNs has been popular in computer vision, }$ 
$\text{and are gaining popularity in a variety of fields, including radiology}$

$\text{Traditional Fully Connected Neural Networks use CPUs to carry out calculations. Such calculations are wasteful and }$
$\text{slow, and thus make it impossible to meet real-time calculating needs.}$ $\text{As a result, convolutional neural networks based}$
$\text{on graphics processing units (GPUs) are commonly used. The literature evaluated CNN open source projects that use GPUs and }$
$\text{ discovered that GPUs have some drawbacks, such as high power consumption and high cost. Taking this into account,}$
$\text{FPGA is a better fit as it is a low power device, which provides a similar degree of acceleration to a GPU.}$

$\text{In this project fully connected neural network is implemented in synthesizable} \textbf{ Verilog}. $\text{This is deployable}$
$\text{on FPGAs after some minor changes.}$
